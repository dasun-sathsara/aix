## You

Your prompt contains a Python code snippet and an error message.

The code snippet defines a simple function `add` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

The error message indicates that a `TypeError` occurred during the execution of the `add` function.  Specifically, it states that the `+` operator cannot be used with an `int` and a `str` (integer and string). This means that the function was called with one argument being an integer and the other a string, preventing them from being directly added together.
